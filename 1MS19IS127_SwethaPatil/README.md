# DL first assignment
### The anomaly percent  observed is  80%
## Dataset used : Dataset 17
## Steps Followed
The below steps are carried out:
- import modules and read the file with pandas
- usable data is identified 
- Only numeric valued columns are retained and spread of the data is observed
- Stats like mean and median are found
- Plots are made by normalizing and identifying anamolies. 80 % from mean is observed as anamoly

## Formulas used
###  -------Mean is ```sum(X)/len(X)```
###  -------Min Max Scaler is ```x' = (x - min(X)) / (max(X) - min(X))```
### -------Median is ```mid(sorted(X))```
### -------Standard Scaler / Z Scaler is ```x' = (x - mean(X)) / std(X)```
### ------- Max Absolute Scaler is ```x' = x / max(abs(X))```
