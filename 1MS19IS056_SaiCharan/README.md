### Anomaly percent - 85%

## Steps Followed
- Importing required libraries
- Converting given dataset ( 17.txt ) to DataFrame
- Adding Column header
- Retrieving the description of the DataFrame
- Plots are made and anomalies are plotted in red

## Formulae :
- Mean is ```sum(X)/len(X)```
- Median is ```mid(sorted(X))```
- Min Max Scaler is ```x' = (x - min(X)) / (max(X) - min(X))```
- Z Scaler is ```x' = (x - mean(X)) / std(X)```
- Max Absolute Scaler is ```x' = x / max(abs(X))```
